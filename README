Coders Submission Project

This is a web application using a paginated API that displays submissions and another API that displays statistical 
analysis of submissions. Filtering submissions based on title, language and satuts is also possible.

Python/Django backend used for creating APIs.
AngularJs used for setting up a single page application.

Project structure:
	APIs can be found in jda/api/views.py
	Project settings can be found in jda/jda/settings.py
	Database/staticfiles/template/Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings are available in settings.py
	AngularJS code can be found in jda/static/angular_apps

Project Finer points:
	CORS headers middleware added catering to CORS related errors.
	Paginated API for submissions
	AngularJS used for setting up single page architecture

2. Database used: MySQL
	Running MySQL server is needed
	Restore coders.sql file dump to MySQL along with following settings
	MySQL settings:
		db-name: jda
		password: 8558881858
		user: root

3. Run migrations (from jda folder):
	python manage.py migrate

4. Run server (from jda folder):
	python manage.py runserver

	Site accessible as http://127.0.0.1:8000/home


For Production environment:
	nginx as reverse proxy, passed requests to uWSGI server
	uWSGI server for running Django code
	Ansible for code deployment
	Web application can be uploaded to a heroku instance


To Do (if time permits!):
	Set up deployment orchestration using ansible
	Set up test suite	
	Improve UI layout
	Additional search/filter capabilities
